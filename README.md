# ASL Multiverse: Advanced Neural Network Framework for Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of Python tools for simulating Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI data, training advanced neural networks for parameter estimation, and comparing their performance against conventional fitting methods. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Arterial Transit Time (ATT) quantification using the MULTIVERSE ASL framework, which combines pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) and velocity-selective ASL (VSASL).
